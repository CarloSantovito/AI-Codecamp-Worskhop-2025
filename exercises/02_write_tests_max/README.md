# 02 â€“ Write tests for a function

**(Situation)**  
We have a small utility function `find_max` that returns the largest number in a list.

**(Task)**  
Write **at least 3** unit tests in `test_utils.py` to validate expected behavior.

**(Action)**  
Use an AI assistant to:
- Brainstorm edge cases (empty list, negatives, duplicates, single element).
- Draft pytest tests with clear names and minimal fixtures.
- Explain *why* each test matters.

**(Result)**  
`pytest` discovers and runs your tests. All tests pass with the current implementation.
