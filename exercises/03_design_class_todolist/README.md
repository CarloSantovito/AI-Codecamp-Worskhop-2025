# 03 â€“ Design a small class + write tests (TodoList)

**(Situation)**  
We need a tiny in-memory todo manager for a console script. There is no code yet.

**(Task)**  
Implement a `TodoList` class and write tests that prove it works. Keep it simple and readable.

**(Action)**  
Use an AI assistant *as a guide*, not as the author of the final code:
- Ask for a short checklist of steps.
- Draft a minimal API design.
- Write one method at a time, then ask AI for example tests.
- Run tests often; iterate.

**(Result)**  
All your tests pass. The class is 40 lines or less, with a clear docstring and no global state.
